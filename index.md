## Channel and Internet Radio

24 hours Sanskrit Channel.

In so many languages TV channel exists, why not Sanskrit? 

Can happen with **volunteers' Trust**. No selling on Channel. Right now other channels are selling stuffs. Commercial perspective in selling stuffs on these channels. They also become biased etc. It ends the spirit. 

Akashwani, Doordarshan, Literary retired people can join in this. They are skilled. They know their work. 

People learn Hindi automatically. If Sanskrit is to be taught, then it appears it's difficult. 

Take money and do for services not available through volunteers. 

It's story of people joining together. There is no problem of resources. People donate Billions in Tirupati. 

Bandwidth allocation for commercial. Bhandaare. Dry fruits, food. Dharmartha. Gita Press. Important work. Companies should come up. Example, one is not asking money from biscuit company, they can give biscuits. Bandwidth company can donate bandwidth. This way people can come together. 

24 hours will be actually less. Lots to be shown. 

People are spread out. They're held up in own opinions also. Fight between 700 or 701 verses in Bhagavad Gita.

Community Radio. Mobile network too much in prevalence. Internet radio. 24 hours internet radio in Sanskrit not available. 

Server. Content on server. People can upload. Download from there. 

Better to have something than nothing and let it evolve. 

## Dos

Free to air channel. That is how it should come. Should not be based on advertisements. 

Also, Sanskrit will not be taught. By teaching, it seems Sanskrit is difficult to learn. 

It's a common language. People learn own when it's served in interesting manner.

All practical stuffs to be shown. 

**No opposition, no business, no criticism**.

Like no selling on [www.arvindguptatoys.com](www.arvindguptatoys.com). 
 
People can donate time and skills. There are so many spirited sincere skilled and intellectual people. 

Debian, or BSD type architecture. 

Unity of sects will be projected. Citations will come out. China, Japan tell separately they follow Buddhism. Segregation. But all citations will come out from Sanskrit. 

**Education, manchan, natak. Samanya roop. Not difficult. Easy Sanskrit.** 

**Charts, real valuable information will come.**

**Why not talk of cultural fairs? Explain about that. Pushkar Mela. Pongal, Onam, Kuchipudi. Tell about that. Bharatnatyam.**

Horizontal. Merit. 

Sanskrit natak. Not very good quality at the moment. Too much work needed there. 

Shrimadbhagawatam. Saral sanskrit teeka. Padmakumar is doing Bhagavat Amrit. Made nice name. New symbol in name space. Where is script? Is it original? **Multimedia format of Saral Sanskrit Bhagavat.** 

Bhale ka phal bhala is a very neutral story. Vidur Niti. 

Actually useful news will come. 

Strictly public domain. 

## Don'ts

Lot can happen in 24 hours. People are selling astrology, karmakand. This will not happen.

Opinions, flags must not come. Should go by objective spirit. Should be not be specific to some group, side etc.

No prime minister news. No cricket news.

No advertisement. No ulterior motive. No photo of anyone. No selling stuffs.

No narrow mindedness.  No boundaries.

Too much trash on YouTube. Rarely good material. 

Astrology is not proved. Don't put that. It has not been experimentally seen. 

## Good Examples

samprativarta.in. Makes people read sanskrit news. Children read. 

Nirnay Sagar Press. Why did it get closed? Super excellent publication quality. These days story of Gita Press closing coming.

Madan Mohan Malviya. Beginning of a University. Collected funds by visiting every house. People do big work together this way. It's matter of humans' time. 

## Broad-base thinking

Sankuchit mann. One needs to come out of narrow minded only material based thinking. Otherwise nothing can happen. 

Younus Model. Can come in form of social business. Capital was provided. Workers are getting salary. Capital investment. Studio. Camera. Friend Studio in NCR. All left unused. So no problem of resources. People sitting with narrow-mindedness. That's why can't do anything. 

Artificial scarcity is created. Food will get spoiled but will not be given. That is how food is spoiled. Because market price should not get lessened, they let it deteriorate but won't bring out. So there is no scarcity of resources. 

## Architecture

Merit establishment and recognition in FOSS. Picolisp. Academic merit. Community contribution.

Even in 40yp it is given that people will not be coming for idealism, they will be coming for quality of life. 
 
Even in this case, people will watch this channel as they will find useful information that can be understood. 
 
Important for teaching freshers and retired. Earlier in between cannot come to that extent.
   
Baldevanand ji. Will only talk in Sanskrit. No English. This programme will be different.

Vertical tendencies will run away. 

Structure must emerge. 

One must establish structure not people. People establishment is small. Archaryakulam. No Rajasik aadhar.

Team. Rajasik. Contact increasing. Coming in limelight. Selfish cooperation. Name and contacts. Rajasik mansikta. Money accumulation, bossing, selling buying should not happen. Selfish cooperation is acceptable start but not the ultimate goal. 

Two houses. Upper house. Lower house. Upper house is invisible hence invincible, no name no material stake. They're the ones controlling for purely altruistic reason for welfare of all beings, not just humans.

People have to open up properly at start itself. Otherwise there will be surprises later on. 

People can say they have understood later they will say you didn't say this you didn't say that.

Churning involved. Game of samudra manthan. Asur and devta both ran to get hold of amrit kalash. 

### INVISIBLE/UPPER HOUSE

Soldiers of Britishers were sold people. Soldiers like Bhagat Singh could not be bought. They're pristine. Their efficiency is highest. 

Can't be sold. Value is too much. Efficiency also too much. They're wild. 

Pushpa Dikshit ji did so much and has been doing lot of work.

Invisible group will manage. No desires - Lokeshna, vitteshna, putreshna. They will be listened to. This architecture must come up. Invisible but can control. Such people are needed. Also in 40yp like that, community wisdom through people who are visible. They're handful of party people now. About 300. Whereas thousands of people in communities. What we are talking is real democracy. What we see is something else in name of democracy. 

Even in invisible house there can be problems. 

### LOWER HOUSE

Implementation needs be seen. 

Something must emerge.
